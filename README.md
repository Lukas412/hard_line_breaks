# Hard Line Breaks

This repository contains the challenge of creating a better parser than outlined in the video: \
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njki5FPt_SI

The parser here returns the paragraphs in slices instead of allocated strings. \
This parser is shorted than the best parser featured in the video.

The only thing I do not like about this solution, is the use of the turbo fish, \
but I do not know how to get rid of it.
